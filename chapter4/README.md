# Overview

Chapter 4 discusses an overview of using Docker for our project. We experiment with setting up a basic container and then
starting to build out progressively more complex containers.

* `v1` Simple container with CloudBeaver
* `v2` Add as a Postgres database 
* `v3` Begin configuring the Postgres database
* `v4` Add a simple API with FastAPI
* `v5` Add a HTML page running on NGINX
* `v6` Enhancing the example
* `v7` Enhancing the health checks
* `v8` Refactoring cloudbeaver to use a Dockerfile
* `v9` Putting everything together

Additional folders:
* `gen_ai_prompts` Contains output from asking ChatGPT and Copilot to produce `docker-compose.yml` files
* `cloudbeaver` Contains some examples of setting up CloudBeaver in a Docker container
