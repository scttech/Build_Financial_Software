# Chapter 11: IAT Processing

In v1 of the application, we setup:

[X] ACH file creation for IAT batches

[X] Database storage of IAT batches, entries, and addenda

[X] Unit tests for initial IAT processing (SQL and Schema validation)

# Running the ACH Project

For JetBbrains WebStorm, you can run the UI by setting up an `npm` configuration with the command `run` and 
the script `dev`.
