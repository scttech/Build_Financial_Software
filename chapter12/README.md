# Chapter 12: IAT Processing

This chapter will cover some of the basics of processing an IAT batch in an ACH file.

Once we can support the IAT format, we will explore OFAC scanning of the file as part of compliance 
with government regulations.

In v1 of the application, we setup:

[X] ACH file creation for IAT batches
[X] Database storage of IAT batches, entries, and addenda
[X] Unit tests for initial IAT processing (SQL and Schema validation)
