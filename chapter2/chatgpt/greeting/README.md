# Overview

This folder contains examples of working and refining results from ChatGPT. We initially create a greeting and then
as ChatGPT to update it. With the initial example, we are just having fun and exploring what ChatGPT can do.

We also work with a more FinTech based example, exploring ChatGPT's ability to generate text in a more professional context.
