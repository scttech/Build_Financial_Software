Ladies, Gentlemen, and Esteemed Intergalactic Visitors,

On behalf of the people of Earth and as the President of the United Nations, I extend a warm and sincere welcome to our planetary home. Earth, with all its diversity and complexity, is but a tiny fragment in the vast cosmos, and your arrival marks a monumental moment in our shared history.

Our world is rich with a tapestry of cultures, languages, landscapes, and species. Throughout our history, we've endeavored to understand our place in the universe, always with the hope that one day, we might become part of a larger interstellar community. Today, it appears that hope is becoming a reality.

We recognize that your journey here must have been one of great significance. We eagerly await the chance to learn from you and share our own knowledge and experiences. It is our sincerest wish that this first encounter builds a foundation for mutual understanding, respect, and peaceful coexistence.

Let this day be remembered as the dawn of a new era, where beings from different corners of the universe come together in the spirit of curiosity, collaboration, and unity.

Welcome to Earth.
