# Overview

Chapter 3 discusses how we process and parse payments from an ACH file.

The versions of the ACH Processor in this chapter increase the functionality of the processor iteratively.

We also incorporate unit tests for all the functionality introduced.

* `v1` is a great place to start to see a sample of the structure
* `v2` expands on the functionality of parsing each ACH record type
* `v3` addresses some of the challenges in the chapter
