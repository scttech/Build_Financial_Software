# Prompt
Why doesn't this code work?

```python
def last_transactions(user_transactions: list, transaction: str, max: int = 3) -> list:
    """
    Adds a transaction to the list of user transactions and returns the updated list.
    :param user_transactions: List of current transactions
    :param transaction: New transaction
    :param max: Maximum transactions to keep
    :return: Updated list of transactions
    """
    if len(user_transactions) + 1 >= max:
        user_transactions.pop(0)

    user_transactions.append(transaction)

    return user_transactions
```

# Response

The code you've provided is aimed at adding a new transaction to the user's transaction list while ensuring that the length of the list doesn't exceed the given `max`. If adding a new transaction would exceed the `max`, the oldest transaction is removed.

However, there are a couple of issues:

1. The name `max` is a built-in Python function that returns the largest of the input values. It would be better to avoid using it as a variable name. Let's change it to something like `max_length`.

2. The condition for popping a transaction is `if len(user_transactions) + 1 >= max:`. This means if you have `max_length = 3` and the current length of `user_transactions` is 2, it will remove the first transaction before adding the new one, thus always keeping the length as 2. This is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if len(user_transactions) + 1 > max_length:`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def last_transactions(user_transactions: list, transaction: str, max_length: int = 3) -> list:
    """
    Adds a transaction to the list of user transactions and returns the updated list.
    :param user_transactions: List of current transactions
    :param transaction: New transaction
    :param max_length: Maximum transactions to keep
    :return: Updated list of transactions
    """
    if len(user_transactions) + 1 > max_length:
        user_transactions.pop(0)

    user_transactions.append(transaction)

    return user_transactions
```

With these changes, your function should work as intended!
