`Please summarize the Check 21 regulation`

# Response

The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, commonly known as Check 21, is a United States federal law enacted on October 28, 2003. The law became effective on October 28, 2004. Its primary purpose is to improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of the check-clearing system.

Key points of Check 21 include:

   1. Substitute Checks: Check 21 allows banks to create a digital version of a paper check, known as a substitute check. This substitute check is a legal equivalent of the original paper check and can be used for all purposes that the original check could be used for.

   2. Electronic Processing: The regulation promotes the electronic processing of checks, enabling banks to send and receive check images rather than physically transporting paper checks. This speeds up the check-clearing process and reduces the risk of check fraud.

   3. Consumer Rights: Check 21 provides consumers with specific rights, including the right to receive a substitute check upon request and certain protections against errors.

   4. Endorsements and Disclosures: The act requires proper endorsement of substitute checks and mandates disclosures to inform consumers about their rights concerning substitute checks.

Overall, Check 21 modernizes the check-clearing system by allowing the use of electronic images, improving efficiency, and enhancing security.
